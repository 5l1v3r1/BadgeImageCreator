Badge Image Creator
===================

This program takes an image as an input

It allows you to crop the source image at the correct aspect ratio, then scale it down to the correct size

It then allows you to add in filters to sharpen up the image before writing it out as a 2-bit WIF image

The program is written for the BADGEr e-ink badge from Wyolum

This uses the AForge.NET Imaging library for processing.

You can download this from:

Version as of this commit is 2.2.5, which is what this has been tested with.
